In case the user wants to see rviz in external computer, execute:
1 - alias ros_kobuki='export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://10.42.0.1:11311 && export ROS_IP=10.42.0.1' 
2 - ros_kobuki
3 - execute any ros command you want. Everyting will be referenced to the external device.

3.2 - This is very usefull for rviz.

Working remotely with exploration program:

Execute navigation software to explore a room and create a map.
1 - Connect to the NUC wifi: turtlebot_2
2 - ssh turtlebot2@10.42.0.1      	(Password is ros)
3 - roscore

4 - Open another terminal, ssh into the robot again. (Step 2)
4.1 - roslaunch exploracio exploracio_kobuki.launch

5 - Open another terminal, ssh into the robot again. (Step 2)
5.1 - roslaunch exploracio exploracio.launch

The following commands execute the same task as the previous one. This commands are to understand the inner workings of the software.
(All the tasks below has been automated thanks to exploracio_kobuki.launch)

1 - Connect to the NUC wifi: turtlebot_2
2 - ssh turtlebot2@10.42.0.1      	(Password is ros)
3 - roscore

4 - Open another terminal, ssh into the robot again. (Step 2)
4.1 - roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch

5 - Open another terminal, ssh into the robot again. (Step 2)
5.1 - roslaunch rplidar_ros rplidar.launch

6 - Open another terminal, ssh into the robot again. (Step 2)
6.1 - Check everything is ok (nodes and topics) 
	rostopic list -> Must appear /scan topic

7 - roslaunch turtlebot_rplidar gmapping.launch 

8 - Open another terminal, ssh into the robot again. (Step 2)
8.1 Exectar el node de trobar fronteres.

9 - Open another terminal, ssh into the robot again. (Step 2)
9.1- roslaunch exploracio exploracio.launch
