KNN:

Three different KNN algorithms Brute force, ball tree and KD tree. Due to having 13 dimensions and an increased number of samples,
KD tree will be the most efficient. This is due to the fact that KDTree O[Dlog(N)] and Bruteforce O[DN]. 
Also bruteforce is more effcient when we have less than 30 samples.


Neural Networks: 

Multi Layer Perception (MLP) Classifier.
The model supports multi-label classification in which a sample can belong to more than one class.
We have found NNs to be more efficient than KNN offering the same accuracy. 


SVM: Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel SVM.
